What your project is/does (and what it's called)
My project is called timemanagment, and it is a small website to use as a time managment tool with a pomodoro timer and a todo list to keep you focused.

Why you made your project
I made this project because all the pomodoro or todo websites i use distract me too much with all of their features or ads, so i never end up getting work done,
and i needed to make one more small project, so i decided to make this which i can actually use all the time.

How you made your project
i made this project using HTML, CSS, Flask, Python, and JavaScript, with a Flask framework and python backend with some JavaScript scripts, and HTML/CSS for the UI. 
i tried to make it look aesthetic and cute, so a lot of html and css went into it. 

What you struggled with and what you learned
i struggled with JavaScript especially because i was having a lot of issues with my timer not updating, so i had to write a script in JS, which i am not too comfortable with.
however, i learned a bit and managed to do it after a lot of struggling. also, because this is my last project, i wanted to try using some css, which is also new to me,
so i had to learn that, which was difficult. this was the first project that i put a lot of time into the UI for, but i think it turned out great!
